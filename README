Alex Brinkman's Comments:

I modified the IndividualMarkers and IndividualMarkersNoKinect nodes to publish constant names "ar_marker"

I find that the pose estimate using the IndividualMarkers node to be more stable than the Kinect-enabled version so I recommend using the roman_asus_indiv_no_kinect.launch (and eventually the sbpl_pr2_indiv_no_kinect.launch once it's added)
